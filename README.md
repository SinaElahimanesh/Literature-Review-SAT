# A Literature Review on Self-Attachment Therapy

This repository includes lists of papers, short descriptions, and a link for each on a set of CS topics related to Self-Attachment Therapy (SAT).
The lists are by no means exhaustive. All the data are collected by a human (me :) ) without using crawlers or automated software. As a researcher, the lists can help you get ideas for the possible citations and related work for your paper and find the previous work on your desired topic. In addition to the terms and conditions in the **license file**, you have to **cite this repository** in case you cite any paper in the lists in this repository after looking at the list. Also, you're **not allowed to write any survey or literature review** based on the collected papers in this repository; the only papers allowed to use and cite this repository are research papers, which can use the provided lists while writing the "Related Work" section.

The sentences used for introducing the papers are not necessarily the title of the papers; whenever I thought an excerpt from the abstract (or in open access papers, the body of the paper) could describe what the paper is about, I've used the excerpt (in some cases, modified a bit) as the title for the link. Some articles may be duplicated if the paper specifies multiple important points. You should look at each paper before using them as a citation, and the lists have no guarantee to be correct, so use the contents of this repository at your own risk.

This repository is a work in progress. You can open a pull request if any description is insufficient or wrong or if you want to add or suggest other papers and/or resources.
